Welcome, my name is Chris, I like tech, blah blah blah.

Let's get to the interesting stuff.. I've been running a homelab on a mini PC for about 1 year.
It was a Ubuntu Server with Docker containers. I've recently decided to tear it down and go with Proxmox. 

This blog will be an attempt to document the journey.
I will be documenting what I am doing, how I am doing it, and what I should do differently. 

Stay tuned to follow along.
